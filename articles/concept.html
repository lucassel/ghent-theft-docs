<p>Ghent Theft Auto serves as a versatile testbed for visualising all kinds of data in a 3D environment that is the home of 260.000 residents, each with their own particular lives and activities, accurate to the centimeter.</p>
<p>Possible applications of Ghent Theft Auto are the combination of:</p>
<ul>
<li>visualisation of live geodata, using <a href="https://www.notion.so/Location-acc1b1a8fa404b2e8cbba85d035f24f5">Location</a></li>
<li>visualisation of web served tilemaps, using <a href="https://www.notion.so/WebTileComponent-44bc4a836a144e36bf8a067c350a5342">WebTileComponent</a></li>
<li>visualisation of simulations such as crowd simulations, fluid simulations, etc.</li>
<li>visualisation of real time crowds, using signals from people's mobile devices</li>
<li>visualisation of processes such as <a href="https://www.notion.so/Sanitation-66f79c0a47e04d23a442d63f59a3e939">Sanitation</a> and <a href="https://www.notion.so/Public-transport-57a8e42f0bd64bb5855ed612f6e5a226">Public transport</a></li>
<li>visualizing machine learning inside a 3D environment</li>
<li>rendering a complete city in realtime, even on low-end hardware as VR or mobile</li>
<li>providing a starter kit for real world location games</li>
<li>providing people with the tools so that Ghent Theft Auto can build itself</li>
<li>actually simulate 260.000 citizens living inside the game world</li>
<li>provide OSM spawnable data for all tiles present in the huge Gent in 3D set</li>
</ul>
<p>The scope of Ghent Theft Auto can theoretically be expanded to the complete territory of Belgium, even the world.</p>
<p>In the early days, it didn't take me long to realise that even the &quot;modest&quot; goal of a GTA:IV mod centered around the city center was too big for one person to tackle.</p>
<p>My foolish attempts, and even traditional game design practices are simply not powerful enough to achieve the results I was looking for, especially because of the severe restrictions imposed by the famously patented &quot;zero-budget one-man indie dev&quot; approach.</p>
<p>Ghent Theft Auto quickly becomes a matter of scalability and 'piggy backing'.</p>
<h2 id="-content-creation">👨‍🎨 <strong>Content creation</strong></h2>
<p>Manual content creation is something out of classic game development. When a person sits down at a workstation and interfaces with a GUI in real time to build visual effects. This can be anything from placing models in the editor, unwrapping models in a DCC package, or modelling a gothic landmark.</p>
<p>Manual content creation will always be needed to some extent, but take for instance the plament of trees in a real-world based open world game. It is simply impossible for a person to manage tens of thousands of trees in a hundred square kilometer area.</p>
<p>Where would he/she find the data? Would they navigate to something like Google Maps, pop up a satellite view, alt-tabbing between a webview and trying to place trees one by one, correspondingly in the level editor?</p>
<p>How would they approach the situation where a single tree is chopped down or planted? How would you even become aware of a single tree changing?</p>
<p>Even worse: how would this theoretical person approach something like a shift of the map, or a resize? Would he have to replace every single tree in the map's bounds?</p>
<p>It became clear that simply offloading this rather trivial work by use of programming was the only way forward.</p>
<h2 id="-open-data">🌐 <strong>Open Data</strong></h2>
<p>Luckily, there is a major source of potential we can tap into: geospatial data or open data. Both are based on Geographic Information Software principles and can therefore viewed in the same way.</p>
<p>The three aspects they share and are of great interest to us are:</p>
<ul>
<li>a unique ID, or even a semantic name in the case of tagged geospatial data, offering us a way to <strong>track</strong> the feature.</li>
<li>a coordinate, usually in WGS84 or Mercator format, allowing us to <strong>place</strong> the feature.</li>
<li>tags, usually in a key value format, allowing us to give the feature <strong>meaning</strong> and additional components based on it's characteristics (street_lamp gets a Light component and hooks up to Sun events from the Clock system)</li>
</ul>
<p>Both Open Street Map and Open Data Gent serve their geodata through API's but requesting all data everytime you boot the game isn't feasible for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>size: the data needed would quickly exceed 50 MB which isn't</li>
<li>need: there is no need to update the location for each kindergarten everytime the map is reloaded, one can assume that the lifetime of a physical location being present in reality will exceed the lifetime of the application</li>
<li>load: Let's not load the internet with even more useless wasted resource requests!</li>
<li>availability: data may not always be available clientside (no connection) or serverside (API's could go down)</li>
</ul>
<p>Instead, the used datasets are managed by development and shipped with the game each update.</p>
<h2 id="-projections">📍 <strong>Projections</strong></h2>
<p>Coordinates of real world objects, especially in geospatial data environments, are usually polar coordinates, commonly known as GPS coordinates.</p>
<p>Projecting these 3D spheroid coordinates into a flat 2D cartesian plane is a crucial process in Ghent Theft Auto</p>
<p>Not only do we need this capability when editing the map before making a build, we can leverage it towards updating the map automatically when deployed. It also comes of use when converting the user's Pawn location into a GPS coordinate, allowing for things as reverse geosearching (i.e. retrieving the address the user is at).</p>
<h1 id="-modular-development">🧱 Modular Development</h1>
<p>The combination of Unity Packages and Git submodules allow to take a modular approach to development.</p>
<p>Submodules are embedded directly into the project, whilst tracking their commits. They are core to the game and subject to change a lot.</p>
<p>Unity packages on the other hand (the one's where you link the URL instead of the file location) are used for really nice and isolated functionality such as JSON parsing or the ghent-theft-celestial package.</p>
<p>Functionality should be encapsulated and decoupled as much as possible.
This workflow 'forces' us to think about architecture and to use assembly definitions.</p>
<p>Always show from which module a component comes from.</p>
<p>For instance, one of the functionalities of Ghent Theft Auto is to calculate the position of the sun at any given time above Ghent. By building an interface instead of a one-off hardcoded, though efficient, but ultimately wasteful effort. By making a system that can alter any Unity scene's lighting and rendering to correspond with the time of day at that particular location, I've built myself a self-improving decoupled handy package that I can whack into any future and past's Unity project in order to get that realistic Sun position and behaviour ✌️</p>
<h1 id="-open-data-editor">📝 Open Data Editor</h1>
<p>Since Ghent Theft Auto relies on JSON deserialisation and parsing so heavily, it makes sense to use the same format for saving information about the player and the map.</p>
<p>By editing OSM tags or locations, and saving the edited values to the same format, we can upload data back to OSM servers, essentially resulting in an Open Data Editor.</p>
<h1 id="-digital-twin">👬 Digital Twin</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>A digital twin is a virtual copy of a real life object.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ghent Theft Auto aims to be a digital twin of the city of Ghent. Digital twin is kind of an umbrella term buzz word.</p>
<p><strong>Realtime</strong></p>
<p>In Reatime mode, Ghent Theft Auto is ran as a true copy of Ghent, existing side by side with the city.</p>
<p>The date will be today, the weather will be actual, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Simulation</strong></p>
<p>In Simulation mode, Ghent Theft Auto is ran as a simulation of Ghent, pretending to be a future or previous version of the city. In this mode, when data is not available through historical API's or predictive algorithms, Ghent Theft Auto should be able to fail gracefully and still provide some 'fake' data.</p>
<h1 id="-layers">✅ Layers</h1>
<p>Keep track of where data comes from and provide a way to enable/disable every one of them at Runtime</p>

<blockquote>
<p>An open-world game, set in a pocket-sized metropolis.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's finally happening. After years of being on the background, multiple expansion in scope and conversions to different game engines, Ghent Theft Auto is ramping up to finally, actually be developed.</p>
<p>For those who need a refresher: Ghent Theft Auto started out as a GTA:IV mod, made by an architecture student + friends and volunteers who, honestly, knew close to nothing about real time rendering when we were starting out. The project gained a lot of attention real fast with articles in the major newspapers, airtime on national tv and tens of thousand of downloads. We were invited to talk at developer conferences, with us being the only people in the room who didn't know how to code and geniuses hanging on our lips! Ghent Theft Auto was hot.</p>
<p>But as you know, at some point: newer games are released, people graduate (or don't!), they get job opportunities or move abroad. People, including us, moved on. Life basically happens, so this website went down, the downloads were no longer available, I stopped posting on the page and resorted to silence.</p>
<p>That didn't mean I stopped worked on it entirely. The core idea of Ghent Theft Auto is something that kept me interested along the years, while I worked at architectural visualisation and virtual + augmented reality studios. I kept coming back, looking at the same problems from different angles, again and again. In the weekends I would teach myself how to work with games engines like Unreal Engine 4 using the assets I kept around. When I stumbled upon C# and Unity 3D to create Hololens and mobile AR experiences, I guided my learning path using problems faced when making real world copy of an area that's 211 square kilometers big.</p>
<p>I focused on automating the processes that went behind creating a 3D environment, plopping down trees I retrieve from open source sources onto optimized and accurate heightfield terrain. I scoured various open data portals offered by Ghent, Flanders and Belgium to provide real and meaningful data layers over the map. And before I knew it, I was sitting on what I've always dreamed Ghent Theft Auto could become:</p>
<p>A real game!</p>
<p>That's where we are today. Given the current times: there seems to be no better place and time than here and now to be doing this.</p>
<h4 id="long-time-coming">Long time coming..</h4>
<p>Yes, Ghent Theft Auto's been a long time coming... But then again, it was never supposed to grow this big when we started out!</p>
<p>What started as a race track on the Korenmarkt, quickly expanded into the Zuid, with tangents along the Reep. Along the way, the Overpoort area was added because obvious reasons.</p>
<p>After later excursions into Gent-Sint-Pieters, the Blaarmeersen, Flanders Expo, Oude Dokken, Dampoort: it became obvious this one was gonna last a while.</p>
<p>I remember saying I didn't know where I was taking it exactly but very much doubted I could take it this far.</p>
<h4 id="gf2020">#GF2020</h4>
<p>What if we could take this 3D environment and serve it to you? Once you’re inside, you’ll be able to attend events on the squares with live-streamed sets, walk from stage to stage, meeting your friends in the moving crowds, stop to watch street performers.</p>
<ul>
<li>Watch the Vlasmarkt sunrise and fear the IVAGO crews kicking everybody off the server at midday.</li>
<li>Build your own rollercoaster, or do some target practice at the Vrijdagsmarkt fair!</li>
<li>Wind down and relax in the Baudelo, where you’ll be able to visit and host art galleries.</li>
<li>Enjoy world class visuals and pounding techno music in the Sint-Baafskathedraal, converted into a dark night club.</li>
<li>Unleash your salsa moves on the Polé Polé pontons.</li>
<li>Honor our fire spewing dragon on top of the Belfort!</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="-but-worth-the-wait">.. but worth the wait.</h4>
<p>By using the cancelled Gentse Feesten as a driving force and a first vertical slice that we'll release, I hope to finally be able to spend some real time on this project. Delivering real content to people instead of working on what I like to work on that particular day.</p>
<p>Turning this momentum into an actual game release is worth the effort and continued perseverance.</p>
<p>Since Ghent Theft Auto is built on open source principles, open source data, using open source software, the end goal of Ghent Theft Auto is open source.</p>
<p>A truly open-source release of the assets and data used to build the map, that you can use to build your own mods and games in what ever game engine you choose. If it's got a renderer, it'll work.</p>
